#The use of OpenCV in conjunction with a webcam. An exploration of our software options. 

= Introduction =

Here we try to determine the viability of using a camera and OpenCV to accurately determine the serve speed of a table tennis ball. The spec calls for a cheap system so ideally we will use consumer grade camera and software that will run on even a low-spec laptop without GPU acceleration. 


= Questions =

The main questions and options to be explored:
  * *What frame rate does the camera need:* Assuming a table of 2.74m in length and a ball traveling at 112km/h or 31m/s (considered a very fast serve) the ball will cross the table in 2.65 frames at 30fps and 5.3 frames at 60 fps. So it is likely we will need a minimum of 60fps to have enough frames to analyze in one serve. 
  * *Can we get a suitable camera at a reasonable price:* 60fps seems to be the maximum frame rate we can find for a consumer grade webcam. A potentially suitable example is listed here: http://www.pixmania.ie/ie/uk/11946366/art/computer-gear/12mp-web-cam-and-micropho.html If we need a higher frame rate there are reasonably affordable high-speed cameras that we could use but it would be unlikely we could do real time analysis with it: http://www.pixmania.ie/ie/uk/9636355/art/casio/exilim-high-speed-ex-zr10.html 

  * *How should we track the ball:* To be filled in
