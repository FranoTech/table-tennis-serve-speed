= Steps =

  1. Installation: Open a terminal and input the following. 
{{{
sudo apt-get install build-essential libopencv-* opencv-doc python-opencv python-numpy
}}}

  2. Build examples: 
{{{
mkdir examples ; cd examples
cp -r /usr/share/doc/opencv-doc/examples .
cd c
gunzip *.gz
sh build_all.sh
}}}
Note: Not all examples work. To build cpp examples copy build_all.sh to cpp folder, extract all .gz files and then run the script like before.
